                <li>Associate's or Bachelor's Degree: Many employers prefer or require an Associate's or Bachelor's degree in a technical field like Information Technology (IT), Computer Science, or Computer Engineering. This formal education helps you understand core hardware, software, and networking principles.

</li>
                <li>Alternative Technical Training: A degree may be substituted with a vocational certificate from a technical school, completion of an intensive IT bootcamp, or documented experience combined with industry certifications.

            <ul>
                <li>Technical Troubleshooting: Core knowledge includes how to diagnose and resolve issues related to operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), common business applications, and basic network connectivity (TCP/IP, Wi-Fi).

</li>
                <li>Customer Service and Communication: Exceptional listening and communication skills are paramount for understanding non-technical users and explaining complex solutions clearly and patiently.

        <div id="certifications">

            <ul>
                <li>CompTIA A+: This is the industry-standard certification for entry-level IT professionals. It validates foundational knowledge of hardware, software, networking, and security, and is often a minimum requirement for help desk roles.

</li>
                <li>Microsoft and Cisco Certifications: Specialized certifications like Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) or Cisco Certified Technician (CCT) can be beneficial, especially if the role focuses on a specific vendor's products or cloud services.
