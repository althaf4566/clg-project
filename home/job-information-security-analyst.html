            <h2>Education and Qualifications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bachelor's Degree: Most positions require at least a Bachelor's degree in a relevant field such as Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Technology (IT), or Computer Engineering.</li>
                <li>Specialized Knowledge: The degree should provide a strong foundation in areas like networking, programming, security principles, and operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows).</li>
                <li>Alternative Paths: While a bachelor's is typical, some employers may consider candidates with an Associate's degree, a professional certification, and significant relevant industry training or experience.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="skills-knowledge">
            <h2>Skills and Knowledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical Proficiency: Must have a solid grasp of network security controls (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems), data encryption, and vulnerability assessment tools. Scripting languages like Python or PowerShell for automation are also highly valuable.</li>
                <li>Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills: The ability to monitor systems, detect subtle anomalies in log data, and quickly analyze the root cause of security incidents to implement effective, timely solutions.</li>
                <li>Communication and Attention to Detail: Excellent communication skills are needed to clearly explain complex security risks to both technical teams and non-technical management. A detail-oriented approach is critical to spotting small oversights that could lead to a major security vulnerability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="certifications">
            <h2>Certifications</h2>

                <li>Mid-Level to Advanced Certifications: For career progression, more specialized credentials such as (ISC)² Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP), CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+), or (ISC)² Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) (which typically requires several years of relevant experience) are highly sought after.</li>
                <li>Specialization: Other popular certifications include Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), which focuses on penetration testing skills, and ISACA Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), which focuses on IT audit, control, and security.</li>

                <li>Hands-on Training: Practical experience is crucial. This can be gained through internships during education, participating in hands-on training programs, setting up security "home labs," or engaging in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to practice threat detection and security flaw identification.</li>
                <li>Continuous Learning: Due to the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, continuous professional development, training on new security technologies, and staying updated on the latest hacking techniques are mandatory.</li>
